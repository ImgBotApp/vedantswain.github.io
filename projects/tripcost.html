								<h2 id="section1">Introduction</h2>
								<p>
									Driving is the second highest expense for the average American household. Yet few people know the the value their vehicles, and most cannot estimate accurately how much a common driving trip (like a daily commute) costs. There are an increasing number of viable alternatives for personal transportation, such as cab services, ride-sharing, transit, biking, and walking. Cost is one factor in transportation mode choice, and awareness of the cost of driving is useful in making better informed decisions. To bridge this awareness gap, we built and deployed a mobile system that makes the total cost of each driving trip (beyond just fuel expenses) visible to the user. After this intervention, participants were able to more accurately and confidently estimate costs of their driving commutes, and extrapolate this knowledge to other trips for which they had not seen a cost.
									<br>
									However, this newfound knowledge was not always enough to really change the car owners behaviours. Although they could now estimate better, their method of countering this was not necessarily as expected, i.e. not all of them reconsidered continuing their daily trips. Apart from this there's a need to address the believability of what is being represented to them. In light of all of this we now set out to provide a better nudge to these car owners that can actually lead them to take more informed decisions beyond just building their knowledge.

Revamping the method of intervention for the users was of prime importance to the next steps for this project, and I was strongly involved in this. Another significant influence of mine was on creating interactions for the user that helps them view the information more tangibly.

								<h2 id="section2">Past Work</h2>
								<h3 id="section2-1">The Tool Itself</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
									The system aims to frame the unit of analysis of measure for car owners on a per-trip basis. After every car trip the user is nudged with meaningful information for that trip itself. The model aggregates both fixed and per-trip costs, including ownership (depreciation), fuel, maintenance, insurance, taxes, and fees, and produces a personalized cost estimate for each driving trip, based on the user’s specific vehicle and actual fuel use and distance traveled.
								</p>
								<p>The cost model can be broken down as follows: </p>

								<div class="container">
									  <div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
									    <div class="col-sm-4" style="text-align:center; font-size: small;">
									    	<b>Fuel Cost</b>
									    </div>
									    <div class="col-sm-8" style="text-align:center; font-size: small;">
									    	<i>= (Fuel Cost per Gallon / Fuel Miles per Gallon) x Trip Length</i><br>
									    	This is the most "obvious" expense of driving a car. The only variable that is a function of the trip is the length itself. The fuel cost, though not strictly invariant, can still be perceptually considered an average stable value (or one that changes slowly).
									    </div>
									  </div>
  									  <div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
									    <div class="col-sm-4" style="text-align:center; font-size: small;">
									    	<b>Other Costs</b>
									    </div>
									    <div class="col-sm-8" style="text-align:center; font-size: small;">
									    	<i>= Operating Costs + Ownership Costs</i><br>
									    	This is the invisible value we are trying to draw the user's attention too. The "hidden cost" is also varies as a function of the trip length and generally adds to the expected fuel cost. Most of the persuasive argument suggested by the system hinges on revealing this cost to the car owners.
									    </div>
									  </div>
								</div>

								<br>
								<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
									The multiple operands used to calculate these costs are either retrieved on-the-fly (such as trip length), sourced from databases like that Kelly Blue Book (such as yearly depreciation of a given car) or manually calculated and loaded to the system by the researchers.
								</p>
								<p>The apparatus that was used to create this solution and study its effectiveness relies on two major components: </p>

	  							<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
	  								What already has been established by the study is that highlighting the hidden costs augments an individuals knowledge about the cost of owning and operating their own vehicle. What needs to be  further explored however, is that there is a connection between increased awareness of driving costs with the choice of which kind of transport an individual may decide to use daily.

									    	Currently users view the breakdown of the per trip cost, via the static segmented gauge that shows the fuel and "other costs". The other costs which one might consider to be "fixed costs" could be interpreted to be static. Due to this, even after becoming aware of the hidden cost, individuals might think of it as "a cost they will incur anyway" - so they might as well try to increase the per-trip cost (and decrease the percentage of the other cost segment) to get maximum value of each trip.

									    	Of the 9 participants 7 wanted to understand better what the "Other Costs" are. 4 of them specifically asked for the difference between per trip costs and "fixed costs".

Or would logging their trip on an online dashboard yield the same result? Or are they just primed to believe the data on the phone because of study biases?<br>

								<div class="container">
									<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
										<div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;">
											<b>Dynamic Story-Telling</b><br>
											Instead of using the static horizontal bar, that immediately pops up at the user at end of each trip, we implemented a narrative method to send the point of the information across more effectively. <br>
											The first change in this was to use relatable _metaphors_. The first of these is to use a vertical bar to represent the fact that costs "rise". Naturally, we needed to exemplify rising costs better - this was done by showing a animated meter to the user instead of the old static one. <br>
											Also, to improve the story of the hidden costs to your trips, the cost segments are ordered in a very specific manner. First the fuel cost is shown, then there's a momentary pause, then the meter rises to represent the operating cost, another pause and then finally we see the ownership costs rise on top of that.<br>
											The motivation of using this method is to always give the user a feeling of increase and stacking over. Such an attempt communicates the aim of the persuasive information far better than the old UI. It is more complex in terms of elements, but also more intuitive for the user to understand and make a sensible inference.

        								<div class="col-sm-4" style="text-align:center">

										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
										<div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;">
											<b>Drill Down Interactions</b><br>
											Many participants voiced that they want the tool to let them be more incisive about the information they are presented. There was a need to get further details when it came to the extra costs in particular. The new interface gets rid of the ambiguous "other costs" and replaces it with the far more explanatory ownership and operating costs.<br>
											This issue is addressed by allowing the users to engage with the visual elements of the screen. They can now tap on a segment to drill down into how that segment's value is calculated and what it really means.<br>
											Another possibility could be to show them another vertical meter representing the different elements of a segment when they click on it. Think of it as a recursive set of gauges the participant can keep drilling into based on how inquisitive they are.

        								<div class="col-sm-4" style="text-align:center">

										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em;">
										<div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;">
											<b>Placebo Study</b><br>
											The best way to verify the effectiveness of our solution and truly meaningful it is would be to perform a field study. Here the participant group would use a "placebo" instead of the actual application.<br> 
											The participants would be briefed about the application exactly the same way as before. Unlike the original study however, the new tool will not report per-trip estimates to the user after every ride but a single estimate at the end of the study. This will not actually be calculated on the fly, but rather via static values the researchers would manually calculate for a participant before the study. Then, based on a follow up interview, it would be measured how believable the nudges provided by the tool are to the user.<br>
											Variations of this study could be to use two groups, 1 where the OBD is installed in the cars and another where it isn't. This can reveal what effects does a visible apparatus like the OBD have on the user.

								<h2 id="section5">Planned Study</h2>

								<p style:"margin-bottom:1em;">
									The nitty-gritty of the placebo study mentioned above have still not been finalized. Yet some requirements from the researchers end have arisen, which would make the study simpler for them to conduct.<br>
									Keeping these demands in mind, the features specifically designed for providing a smooth experience to the facilitators.

											<b>Discretionary Access</b><br>
											The study is primarily going to rely on a <i>Wizard of Oz</i> like method. And the beauty of this technique relies on letting the user see the man behind the curtain. How the wizard performs the trick should be left a mystery for the magic to be effective.<br>
											In the context of our system, that would mean providing master access to the facilitators to change the configurations on the system and denying these privileges to a regular user. This is implemented by simply adding a passcode lock on most of the power features. Therefore, a user can't access the app's settings (where the variable values for the costs to be calculated reside), nor can they have a look at visualisations in-between the study.

										<div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;">
											<b>Remote Narration</b><br>
											The new tool houses 3 different meters. The first being a simple bar showing the fuel cost. The next one is bisected with fuel costs and the operating costs stacked on tip of that. The last consists of a third segment stacked on top representing the ownership cost.<br>
											At the end of the study, when the participant would be interviewed as they check the app they would be asked questions after they view each meter. The aim of this is to understand how they interpret costs, when certain values are truly hidden. Moreover, it can highlight how they react when the hidden values are revealed to them.<br>
											Therefore, the facilitators need to be in control of the narrative or the flow of the app. To do this we established a <i>Firebase</i> communication stream for the app to receive data pushed to it. The facilitator can push the information about which screen to traverse to from a simple python script we prepared to talk to the Firebase cloud messaging service.

								This study is expected to be conducted sometime in Spring 2017. The learnings from this would propel us towards the next iteration where we would also explore how to replace the utility of the OBD with a more scalable solution. Eventually we are looking to deploy this tool for a greater sample set, and obtain more conclusive results.
