								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>PChatting on anonymously on specific topic channels is not uncommon. However, when the physical world slowly shifted to the digital, there was an inflow of nuisance elements as well. This has lead to a lot of cases of trolling, harassment and annoyances.</p>
								<p>Simply talking about what one likes with someone who also likes it may not always be a pleasant experience.</p>
								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>A topic-centric chat app with reputation based filters to ward off those who plan to ruin the hopes of possibly fine conversation. In order to establish such a system, every user must maintain a topic wise reputation. This reputation can be earned via peer appreciation during conversations. </p>
								
								<h2>Features</h2>
								<ul class="bxslider">
  <li class="app-feature">
  	<img src="../images/project_images/spalk/screen1.jpg"/>
  	<div class="app-feature content">
  		<h3>Categorised Topics</h3>
								<p>Topics are indexed at the backend based on categories. This is specifically to make the search for new topics easier.
</p>
  	</div>
  </li>
  <li class="app-feature">
  	<img src="../images/project_images/spalk/screen2.jpg"/>
  	<div class="app-feature content">
								<h3>Trending Topics</h3>

<p>Topics undergo a temporal decay. When a topic is interacted with more regularly it climbs higher up the trending ladder.
</p>

  	</div>
  </li>
  <li class="app-feature">
  	<img src="../images/project_images/spalk/screen3.jpg"/>
  	<div class="app-feature content">
  		<h3>Reputation Based Filtering</h3>

<p>A user may choose a reputation threshold (less than that of their own) for finding a match to converse with it. Users will only be paired if their reputation scores are above the thresholds set by each other.
</p>

<p>Additionally location based filtering may also be done. If this option is checked then the pairing of users will be further restricted to the userâ€™s cities.
</p>

  	</div>
  </li>
 
  <li class="app-feature">
  	<img src="../images/project_images/spalk/screen4.jpg"/>
  	<div class="app-feature content">
  		<h3>Peer Approval</h3>

<p>Each user may score the other user during conversation in real time. This score given by another user is only revealed at the end of the conversation. This contributes to the overall score.
</p>
</div>
  </li>

   <li class="app-feature">
  	<img src="../images/project_images/spalk/screen5.jpg"/>
  	<div class="app-feature content">
  		<h3>Profile Statistics</h3>

<p>Each user can view which topic they chat the most on. Along with which they can also see the topics they have maximum reputation on. Apart from which a topic wise reputation split and a total reputation is also presented.
</p>

  	</div>
  </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Application Flow</h2>

<img class="project-img" src="../images/project_images/spalk/pic1.jpg">

<h2>Future</h2>

<h3>More Avenues to Gain Reputation</h3>

<p>Currently peer approval is the only way to earn reputation points. Subsequent iterations of the app could consider other samaritan tasks to increase reputation. E.g. Filling in details for topics</p>

<h3>Group Chat</h3>

<p>Supporting multiple individuals on a single conversation can be explored to improve the reputation gain system. E.g. Approvals from all other individuals can lead to bonuses.</p>
