								<h2 id="section1">Introduction</h2>
								<p>
									The Rapid Prompting Method (RPM) was developed by an Indian mother, Soma Mukhopadhyay, to teach her non-verbal austistic son, Tito, to communicate. The main objective of RPM is to help “verbal and written expression”, i.e. to read, write and type. 
									<br>
									Letterboards are key artifacts to facilitate learning through RPM. During initial phases the letterboard is used by educators (teachers and/or parents) to conduct lessons. 
									In order to augment the evaluation method, by making it more data-driven we designed a prototype smart letterboard that captures inputs as well as logs performance to responsive interface in realtime.

								</p>

								<h2 id="sectionX">My Role</h2>

								<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									Constructing this instrument was the core component of our coursework in Design of Interactive Environments. 
									The initial user research involved all group members participating. The division of labour for the development phase was more specific.
									Broadly, it was built on 3 pillars; hardware, network and interface.

									    </div>
									    <div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;">
											In order to keep the prime artefact, the letterboard, similar to the traditional form we decided to take an embedded systems approach. 
											Our hardware was rigged with circuits and augmented with an Arduino that communicates in realtime with a monitoring dashboard. 
											In my role, I had to setup an intermediate server as well as the communication interfaces on the both the hardware and the UI side. 
											Additionally, I was also responsible for determining the feasibility of other connected devices - that could help monitoring - during the early stages of development.

								<h2 id="section2">The Problem</h2>

								<h3 id="section2-1">How RPM Works</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">We were fortunate to get access to a private english lesson of an autistic child. 
									The three major players of a session like this are the student, the facilitator and the parent. In some cases the latter two can be the same.
									Based on this, we can describe the communication between the players as follows:
								</p>
									
								<img src="../images/project_images/reco/pics/target.png" class="project-thumb" style="width:80%">
								<br>

								<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									Practitioners of this method are often self-taught or acquire this skill through workshops, or through other facilitators. 
									Parents, for example, pick this up from facilitators, so that they are equipped to conduct lessons on their own. 
									Our understanding is that continuous use of this method can lead to children communicating unassisted via the letterboard and eventually even move onto typing.
								</p>

								<h3 id="section2-3">Observations</h3>
								
								<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									One of our major observations was the asynchronous relation between the child's cognitive ability and their motor movements, and how this influences 
									their performance with during an RPM lesson. <br>
									
									<img src="../images/project_images/reco/pics/target.png" class="project-thumb" style="width:80%">
									<br>

									In the case we observed, the child was in the verbal band of the autism spectrum. This helped us discern their general ability in spelling as well as constructing sentences. 
									Often however, this would not entirely line up with the coordination of their input. To put it simply, the letter they want to indicate might be 'X' but their input would be 
									at 'R'. <br>
									However, we could extrapolate that in the case of non-verbal autism, such an assertion is hard to make, since the child's general learning ability can be questioned, i.e. 
									they letter they wanted to indicate is indeed 'R', even though that's not the correct letter. 
								</p>

								<h3 id="section2-3">Challenges</h3>

								<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
									Based on our personal observations and informal interviews with the facilitator and parent we could identify certain painpoints of this method. <br>
									As a process, using RPM via letterboards to teach is very instinctive and intimate. Different individuals could have varying approaches to this,
									for example the facilitator we observed had developed a sing-song prompting style. Interestingly enough the parent did not use this method to nudge the child.
									The onus is on the facilitator to guide the child during their learning phase. However, the method of evaluating a child's perfomace through a session is 
									rather rudimentary - pen and paper.   
								</p>

								<div class="container">
									<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
										<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
											<b>Observation</b><br>
											<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/thoughts.png" style="width: 3em;">
										</div>
										<div class="col-sm-9" style="font-size: small;top: 2em;">
											Evaluating the child's performance manually is complicated. Keeping a check on the child's interactions (eye movements, verbal cues and interactions) 
											along with correcting the actual inputs (checking the spelling, grammar or structure) is a difficult to manage by single individual simultaneously. 
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
										<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
											<b>Data</b><br>
											<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/actions.png" style="width: 3em;">
										</div>
										<div class="col-sm-9" style="font-size: small;top: 2em;">
											Apart from manual, self-reported markings and annotations there is no convenient way of tracking a child's itneractions. 
											This is essential for revising the facilitation of prompts by understanding how the child makes errors. 
											Some attempts using cameras have been made to mitigate this, however these can often be obtrusive and disrupt the sessions entirely.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
										<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
											<b>Participation</b><br>
											<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/actions.png" style="width: 3em;">
										</div>
										<div class="col-sm-9" style="font-size: small;top: 2em;">
											Involving a parent into the RPM session could be considered a means to distribute the load on the facilitator. 
											However, we learnt that physically co-locating a parent in the same space could distract the child (if they are not the facilitators themselves). 
											This makes it complicated to provide parents and other aids some form of reflection with regard to the child's goals.	
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>
									Apart from these challenges other issues that may arrise are specific to the child's inherent or learnt skills upto that point.
								</p>

							<h2 id="section3">The Design</h2>

							<h3 id="section3-1">User</h3>
							<p>Before designing our solution we wanted to concretize who really our user is. To simple put our users can be described as: </p>

							<div class="container">
								  <div class="row">
								    <div class="col-sm-12" style="font-size: small;">
								    	Students
								    </div>
								  </div>
								  <div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;">
								    	studying in the Georgia Tech Atlanta Campus
								    </div>
								  </div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-6" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-6" style="font-size: small;">
								    	disposing trash in source separated bins
								    </div>
								  </div>
  								</div>
  							<p></p>
							<p>	Our typical user also needed to be characterized, so we personify them as follows:</p>

							<div class="container">
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Thoughts</b><br>

								    	System designs are confusing |
								    
								    	Individual actions are insignificant |

								</div>
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">

								    <div class="col-sm-9" style="font-size: small;top: 2em;">
								    	Most convenient given the socio-temporal context |

								    	Conforms to how others have behaved
								    </div>
								</div>
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Wants</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/wants.png" style="width: 3em;">
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-9" style="font-size: small;top: 2em;">
								    	Improve sorting accuracy |

								    	Do more than the average citizen |

								    	Contribute positively towards the environment
								    </div>
								</div>
  							</div>
  							<p></p>

							<h3 id="section3-2">Divergence</h3>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
								To continue with our design process we consciously  decided to consider infrastructural inconsistencies or inadequacies (such as the structural design of bins) as a constraint we have to work around.<br> 
								Thus we wanted a solution that is robust as well as easy to implement and scale - this helped us filter out ideas like static redesigns of the graphics or the structures of the bins.
							</p>

							<img src="../images/project_images/reco/pics/target.png" class="project-thumb" style="width:80%">
							<br>

							<p>
								In order to structure our brainstorming solutions we agreed to look for ideas within the realm of <i>Behavioural Technology</i>. The reason for this was to mitigate the challenges faced by the user by persuading them to take better decisions in regarding daily waste segregation.
								<br>Thus there were 3 main verticals within which we explored possibilities:
							</p>

							<div class="container">
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Nudges</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/nudge.png" style="width:4em;">
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;top: 30px;">
								    	Providing users actionable information in the moment they perform the task
								    </div>
								</div>
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Reflection</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/reflection.png" style="width:4em">
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;top: 30px;">
								    	Tracking the user's activity and representing them as meaningful informatics
								    </div>
								</div>
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Learning</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/learning.png" style="width:4em">
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;top: 30px;">
								    	Training/teaching the users with regular/repeated practice
								    </div>
								</div>
  							</div>

  							<p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  								Thus through the course of our brainstorming we arrived at multiple ideas. Each of these not only involved multiple different technological approaches but also dealt with different time frames of interventions of the waste-segregation activity cycle.
  								<br>
  								While we did come up with a variety of ideas, many of these overlapped with each other in certain atomic aspects. Another point of note at this stage was that not every idea was solving the same problem - not exactly anyway.
  							</p>

  							<div class="row">
							    <div class="col-sm-12" style="text-align:center; font-size: small;">
							    	<b style="color: #008d28; font-size: -webkit-xxx-large;">21</b><br>
							    	Total number of ideas we came up with at the end of brainstorming the brainstorming session.
							    </div>
							</div>

							<p></p>

							<h3 id="section3-3">Convergence</h3>

							<p>
								From our literature review of other solutions in the same space as us, we stumbled across mentions of the <i>Trans-theoretical Model</i>. This explains human behaviour in 5 chronological phases. We used these different stages to arrange our ideas.
							</p>

							<div class="container">
								  <div class="row">
								    <div class="col-sm-12" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<b>Precontemplation: </b> <i>Subconsciousness</i> E.g. Lockscreen utility that slowly trains you about segregation practices by screen unlock quizzes
								    </div>
								  </div>
								  <div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-1" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
									<div class="col-sm-11" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<b>Contemplation: </b> <i>Consciousness</i> E.g. AR based educational game that teaches you about how to segregate correctly by competitive gamification
								    </div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-2" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-10" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<b>Preparation: </b> <i>Pre-Action</i> E.g. Holographic demonstrations showing which items are permissible within a particular bin
								    </div>
								  </div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-9" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<b>Action: </b> <i>Action</i> E.g. Haptic feedbacks that alerts user where to throw the trash right before they toss an item
								    </div>
								  </div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<b>Maintenance: </b> <i>Monitoring</i> E.g. Providing users feedback from experts after they've disposed a trash item
								    </div>
								  </div>
  								</div>
  							<p></p>
							<p style="margin-bottom:1em">
								Sorting our ideas along these lines helped us understand which ideas were similar or had a similar method of approach. Due to this we were able to merge aspects of certain ideas more easily. Moreover we were able to competitively eliminate ideas that operate within the stage.
								<br>
								Thus we were able to arrive at 4 distinct ideas, each of which tackles the problem from a different angle and employs its own exclusive technique to solve the challenge of segregating waste.

  								Ultimately, we narrowed down the <b>Wearable Nudge Smartwatch App</b> as our final idea. This was based on the fact that it was quick to build, elegant and was far more specific in measuring what we intended to define as our success metrics.
  							</p>

							<h2 id="section4">The Development</h2>

							<h3 id="section4-1">Considerations</h3>
							<p>
								Before we went onto deciding a functional prototype to build we needed to draw out certain design decisions that we'd need to adhere to while selecting a solution. These were:
							</p>

							<div class="container">
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em">
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Behaviour Change</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/change.png" style="height:30px;">
								    	<br>
								    	Our goal is to ultimately evoke a change in user behaviour by persuasive nudges and not by force. The idea is to aid the user in making the choice themselves by carefully guiding them in the right path.
								    </div>
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Just in Time</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/timing.png" style="height:30px;">
								    	<br>
								    	The phase where we believe an intervention would be effective was right when the action is taking place. This would dynamically catch the user's attention in the moment and requires less memorisation from the user.
								    </div>
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Convenience</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/convenience.png" style="height:30px;">
								    	<br>
								    	Since our problem area involves an everyday activity, the user's comfort is of our utmost priority. Therefore, the solution shouldn't strongly disrupt the user's routine behaviour and thus should be easy and quick to use.
								    </div>
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small; text-align:center;">
										<b>Knowledge</b><br>
								    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/knowledge1.png" style="height:30px;">
								    	<br>
								    	Ultimately, we want the user to not only do the right thing, but to build knowledge. Naturally, repeated use and clarity of communicating information are prime.
								    </div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>
								The idea that best fit these criteria was that of the <b>Wearable Nudge Smartwatch App</b>.

							<h3 id="section4-2">How it Works</h3>

								  <div class="row">
								    <div class="col-sm-12" style="font-size: small;">
								    	When a user approaches a recycling unit the proximity sensors detect which bin type they are closest to - where they are most likely to dispose off the item they possess

									<div class="col-sm-11" style="font-size: small;">
								    	Based on the bin they are closest to, a vibrating notification is fired on their smartwatch with an initial probe question about the item they possess

								</div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-2" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-10" style="font-size: small;">
								    	The user can answer this question (and every subsequent one) with a simple yes or a no that can be selected by basic swipe actions

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-3" style="font-size: small;">
								    	<div style="height: 2px; background-color: #008d28; margin-top:10px"></div>
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-9" style="font-size: small;">
								    	Finally the user is prompted to throw the item they have in one of the bins or to try another
								    </div>
								  </div>

							<h3 id="section4-3">Final Build</h3>

							<p>
								We identified two main areas of development including the wearable app itself and proximity sensors to be installed on the bins to trigger reaction in the nudging app.  Our initial plan was to develop the wearable app with Java and the proximity sensors with Arduino. However, due to the limited time frame given, we decided that sensing the proximity between user and bin and then triggering a signal to the user’s device can be replaced by a Wizard-of-oz technique. Therefore, we also developed an auxiliary wizard dashboard for a researcher to send signals and trigger a reaction on the wearable.
								<br>
								Before we began developing, we focused on refining the content. Our team paid another visit to the <i>Office of Facilities Management</i> to refine the content and the decision tree to be used in the wearable app that our users traverse through to segregate the waste correctly. We also used graphic design tools such as Sketch to create a quick preview of the UIs before diving into development.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some of the specific decisions we took while building the device were:
							</p>

							<div class="container">
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small;">
										<b>Wizard of Oz</b><br>
								    	The sensor-wearable architecture was complicated to construct given our time limitations. Thus we felt manually triggering a remote notification on the smartwatch when the user walks up to a bin can help us achieve the same effect.
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="text-align:center">
										<img src="../images/project_images/reco/pics/woz.png" alt="A simple clickable dashboard that allows the researcher to quickly pick which bin's probe to fire based on where they see the participant approaching" class="project-thumb" style="height:150px;">
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small;">
										<b>Minimalist UI</b><br>
								    	To ensure maximum convenience we wanted the user to complete the given task with maximum speed. In order to do this we kept a simple aesthetic with basic interactions to minimize distractions.
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="text-align:center">
										<img src="../images/project_images/reco/pics/minimal.png" alt="The UI barely has any clutter and sparing uses only 2 colours apart from basic black and white" class="project-thumb" style="height:150px;">
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small;">
										<b>Concise Framing of Questions</b><br>
								    	Every question asked should be short and to the point as well as easy to understand for the user. Moreover, the user shouldn't be asked too many questions.
								    </div>
								</div>
								<div class="row" style="margin-bottom:1em">
									<div class="col-sm-4" style="font-size: small;">
										<b>Clarity of Terminal State</b><br>
								    	The UI should clearly indicate to the user if they are being asked a probe question or if they are being prompted at an imperative point.
								    </div>
								    <div class="col-sm-8" style="text-align:center">
										<img src="../images/project_images/reco/pics/terminal.png" alt="The terminal state inverts colours and features a coloured emoji" class="project-thumb" style="height:150px;">
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>
								Our final prototype is also designed to help us measure 2 different success metrics. This is done by locally storing the users decisions for each question and how logging the timestamp since their initial probe and their final prompt.
							</p>

							<div class="container">
							  <div class="row">
							    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:center; font-size: small;">
							    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/speed.png" style="height:30px"/>
							    	<br>
							    	<b>Speed</b> <br>
							    	Measuring this passively removes the biases manually logging it in front of the user can lead to
							    </div>
							    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:center; font-size: small;">
							    	<img src="../images/project_images/reco/icons/accuracy.png" style="height:30px"/>
							    	<br>
							    	<b>Accuracy</b> <br>
							    	Logging user decisions not only helps tally correctness of choices but also helps understand how they arrived at a certain state
							    </div>
						  </div>

							<h2 id="section5">Future</h2>

							<h3 id="section5-1">Proposed Study</h3>
							<p>
								Participants will take part in a single session where they interact with <i>reco</i> by completing a waste sorting task.  The task involves sorting predetermined list of 15-20 sample waste items into a group of bins on Georgia Tech's campus.  The list of waste items is designed to be representative of everyday household waste that may be generated by a student.  To account for order effects, waste items will be presented in a random order.
								<br>

								For our first two research objectives, the following two hypotheses will be under consideration:
								<br>
								<i>H1 (comparing accuracy)</i> -
								The overall accuracy of sorting waste will be significantly higher for the group using the <i>reco</i> compared to the controlled group.
								<br>
								<i>H2 (comparing convenience using task time)</i> -
								The overall task time will not be significantly different between the two conditions.
								<br> 
								The study will consist of 40 participants in a between-subjects design, recruited from among the students at Georgia Tech. The experimental group would be performing the task equipped with <i>reco</i> while the control group performs the task as they would in everyday life. 
							</p>

							<p>
								From the findings of this study we hope to understand how well <i>reco</i> really does what it set out to do. And from there we can learn how to hone it into a real scaleable and more accessible solution for the future.
